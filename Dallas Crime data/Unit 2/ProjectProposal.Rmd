# **Dallas Crime Data**

### **Introduction**
  Crime has been prevalent over the years and has become a huge concern to us. It should be taken on a serious note and analyzed properly to reduce the crime rate. Hundreds of crimes are reported daily across the country despite having strict rules and regulations. Although the crime statistics in Dallas report an overall downward trend in crime based on data from 18 years, crimes do happen everyday.

  We aim at further reducing the crime rate by analyzing the crime incident reports that had happened over the years.This analysis can help alert the security systems and security officials to be prepared on how to deal with them in the future. For this purpose, we have the data that the Dallas Crime department - Records Management System has recorded from June 2014 till current date (`r Sys.Date()`).
