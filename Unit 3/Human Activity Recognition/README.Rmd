The R script *humanactivityrecognition.R* cleans the dataset obtained from the Samsung Galaxy S Smartphone. The following steps are performed for tidying  up the data

1. Gather train data
2. Gather test data
3. Merge train and test data
4. Add new variables - ActivityLabel, ActivityName
5. Extract the mean and standard deviation measurements and Calculate the mean of each mean and standard deviation measurement for each activity
6. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. The resultant dataset is written to the file meanSD.csv

The cleaned up dataset is written to the file tidy_data.csv
